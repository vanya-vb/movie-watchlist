# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Watchlist
Movie watchlist is one of the solo projects of [Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/frontend-path-c0j) at the end of module Working with APIs. The challenge is to develop a Movie Watchlist app using a [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/R4N1CrC4LCOWJOLFDuOubM/Movie-Watchlist--Copy-?node-id=0-1&t=vLI8nJUeKYiHFTAT-0). 

## Features
- Users can search for a movie and the app uses the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) to get the results
- Users can save movies to a watchlist which persist during different sessions (using localStorage)

- Index = search page. Calls to OMDB API with the title searched for and displays search results
- Button to "add to watchlist" which saves that data to local storage
- watchlist.html loads and displays data from local storage

## Tech Stack
- Figma
- HTML
- CSS
